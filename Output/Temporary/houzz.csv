United States",,5.0,"July 20, 2023","Beverly Thomas created the most exquisite living space in our 1928 Arts and Crafts home-- we were most definitely a ""diamond in the rough"" when Tom Bijak and Beverly Brunetti took on our project. The bones of the house are wonderful; it was all the other stuff that was in desperate need of updating. And what we have now is a gem, all due to Beverly's gorgeous, historically respectful design and Tom's amazingly efficient, organized and thorough workmanship. Design notes: we needed a renovation that echoed the original vintage design of the house-- without having a fussy look. From knocking down a wall, replacing 95-year-old plumbing to creating an archway that looked like it was part of original home to adding tiny elements such as a recessed shelf in the new arch, Beverly Thomas built everything just perfectly. The sub crews were phenomenal-- true artisans who are real masters of their crafts. I received almost daily photos and summaries of the day's work, with projections for the next day's work. A very important point here: at no point did I have any surprise big expenses.. At every point in the project Tom worked carefully to stay on budget, which he did. It was absolutely my lucky day when I met this wonderful team.",12,,9 Houzz Awards

Danny Peterson has been involved in the remodeling industry for over 20 years. Earlier in his life, he was a senior merchant for a huge home improvement company. He would do multi-million dollar deals on a handshake, because people knew if Danny said it, they could count on it. Then Danny became a salesman in the home improvement industry, and what he saw made him extremely disheartened. He felt that companies treated customers as dollar signs instead of people, and they would compromise the value of their work in pursuit of profit. Danny promised that when he opened his own company, he would treat every customer with the respect they deserved, and would always go the extra mile to get the job done right. 

Integrity Home Pro is the result of Danny’s belief in Christian principles and integrity. He has experienced amazing success because of his convictions, and he looks forward to the future growth of his company!

OUR STORY
Marks-Woods Construction was born in 2001 when Byron Woods and Greg Marks cast the vision for a construction company that would offer expertise, an enjoyable customer experience, and a stunning end result. The founders met while working for one of the premier top 20 national construction companies. The two men joined years of experience and a common commitment to excellence in construction to create Marks-Woods Construction. Years later, Drew Marks joined Byron and Greg in ownership of the company, and Marks-Woods Construction became complete. The company first focused on a combination of residential and commercial projects, but eventually found its true niche as a design-build firm dedicated to making the vision and desires of homeowners a reality. Marks-Woods Construction is now the top choice for major additions, kitchen renovations, interior design, and a variety of other major residential construction services. With hundreds of projects completed, Marks-Woods continues to grow and hopes to expand to more geographical areas in future years.

They completed a large interior renovation that included creating an open concept kitchen/living/dining room area and building a new powder room on the first floor and updating our primary bath on the second floor. We were super impressed with Greg when we met with him for our proposal meeting. The design manager kept us in the loop during the entire pre-design process and the project manager was always available to answer questions when they arose during construction. We had a slight delay due to a tile we loved being discontinued, but they were quick to select alternatives that we actually ended up liking even better.
